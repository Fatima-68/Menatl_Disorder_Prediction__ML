🧠 Mental Health Disorder Prediction App
This is a full-stack machine learning web application that predicts possible mental health disorders based on user input. It takes 17 psychological and behavioral features as numerical input and returns a predicted diagnosis using a trained machine learning model.

🚀 Features
🌐 Frontend built with Next.js (React) for a responsive and user-friendly interface.

🔄 Backend API Gateway using Node.js + Express to route requests securely.

🧪 Machine Learning Backend using Flask + scikit-learn with a trained Random Forest / Logistic Regression / SVM model.

📊 Accepts 17 behavioral inputs such as Sadness, Mood Swings, Sleep Disorder, Concentration, etc.

📦 Joblib used to serialize and load the best-performing model.

🔍 Displays prediction results instantly on the frontend.

🧪 Model trained using real dataset: Dataset-Mental-Disorders.csv
